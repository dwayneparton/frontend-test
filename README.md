# Notes
Super fun thanks! Thought I'd use the whole 4 hrs, and here's where I'm at. Just a couple notes before tomorrows meeting.

## Class Names
* I wrote the components with bem methodology, mainly because I use that with sass a lot and it keeps the components unique. The idea is that the styles become reusable blocks.

## Feature
* I made a moble content section here. I can think of a few other ways with js, but I opted for css.

## Phone
* The main thing I would change would be the phone image. I would co ahead and round the coners on the screen shot. I made it where it responds regaurdless of size, but the corners were being a bit of a pain.
